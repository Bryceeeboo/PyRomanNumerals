PyRomanNumerals
A decimal to roman numeral converter

This repository hosts python code that converts decimal numbers to roman numerals. It works based on a looping function that cycles through orders of magnitude in decreasing size. This works because roman numerals function the same way in each order of magnitude.

See OOMR-concept.txt for more information.

Another, longer, hard coded function is provided, but not used in the ui.py user interface.
