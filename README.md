PyRomanNumerals
A decimal to roman numeral converter

This repository hosts python code that converts decimal numbers to roman
numerals. It works based on a looping function that cycles through orders of 
magnitude in decreasing size. This works because roman numerals function the
same way in each order of magnitude. See OOMR-concept.txt for more information.

Another longer, hard coded function is provided, but is not used. The two
functions provide the same output.

Run ui.py.
OOMR() is the conversion function, found in numToRoman.py
